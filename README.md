# Remote Control Basestation

This projekt implements a RC base station for the printable RC models from [ProfessorBoots][GithubProfBoots]. You connect with a PS3 controller to the base station. All models also connect to the base station and then you are able to control all models with one controller. You can switch between the models which you want to crontrol.
