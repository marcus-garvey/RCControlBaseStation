# Remote Control Basestation

This project implements a RC base station for the printable RC models from [ProfessorBoots][GithubProfBoots]. You connect with a PS3 controller to the base station. All models also connect to the base station. The base station will relay all input from the controller via WIFI to the models. You can switch between the models with the select button of the controller. So you dont need multiple controller or repair one controller with the model you want control. Simply start the base station connect the controller, start every model you have and play with them.
